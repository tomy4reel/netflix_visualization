# README: Netflix Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains code for analyzing a Netflix dataset, focusing on data cleaning, exploration, and visualization. The code uses Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process and visualize the data.

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis should be a CSV file containing information about Netflix movies and TV shows. The expected columns include:

- `director`: The director of the movie or TV show.
- `cast`: The cast of the movie or TV show.
- `listed_in`: The genre(s) listed for the movie or TV show.
- `rating`: The rating of the movie or TV show.
- `type`: The type of content (e.g., Movie or TV Show).


## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Libraries**: Ensure all required libraries are installed.
- **File Not Found**: Verify the file path and ensure the CSV file exists.
- **Column Names**: Ensure the dataset columns match those expected in the script.
